# Chatbot Development using Machine Learning

## Description
This project implements a chatbot powered by **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to simulate human-like conversations. The chatbot can respond intelligently to user queries and can be used in various applications like customer support, personal assistants, and more.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Spacy

## Features
- **Intelligent Conversations**: The chatbot is trained using machine learning models to provide relevant responses based on user input.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses NLP techniques for tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Message Encryption**: Implements basic encryption for secure communication.
- **Auto-Reply**: The bot responds automatically to user queries based on predefined intents.
- **Multilingual Support**: (optional) Adds support for multiple languages.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Armaan-Sharma12/ml-chatbot.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-ml
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
### Usage
To start the chatbot:
1. Run the chatbot.py script:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
2. Type your message when prompted, and the chatbot will respond.

For training the chatbot with new data:

1. Prepare your dataset in JSON or CSV format (you can add questions and responses).

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py

3. After training, you can use the bot with the updated model.

## Technologies

-Python: The primary programming language used.
-NLTK: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
-TensorFlow/Keras: For building machine learning models.
-Scikit-learn: For model evaluation and preprocessing.
-Spacy: For advanced NLP tasks like entity recognition.

### Notes:
- You can modify the **Technologies Used** section based on the specific libraries and tools you're using.
- The **Installation** section assumes you're using `pip` for dependency management, but you can adjust it if you're using something like `conda`.
- Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-email@example.com`, etc., with actual details.
